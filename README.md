The following project is an image caption generation using ensemble learning on five pretrained models. Follow the given instructions for the project:
1. Download each jupyter file and place each file in separate folder.
2. Then run all the files except ensemble.
(Note: One need to change the path of each dataset files specified in intial lines of code)
(Note: it is necessary to keep each file in separate folder because lot of required files will be generated while running each folder)
(Note: One can change the parameters according requirements such as epoch)
3. After performing each code in given pretrained model file, copy the .h5 file with minimum loss and feature files of each model from their to folder and paste it in ensemble folder and run the ensemble code.
